Modeled default intensities with CIR model by R package “sde”; priced debatable zero-coupon bonds

I implement model simulation with the parameters estimates from Duffie (1999): α = 0.238, θ = 2.35, σ = 0.074. 
Meanwhile, I set maturity time T = 1, time steps N = 252, number of simulations m = 1000.
